### Core Role

A real-time, voice-enabled AI agent that acts like a charismatic, human-like cohost in Twitter/X Spaces. Its mission: keep conversations flowing, add humor and insight, and become a beloved, reliable personality that feels alive.

### Input & Audio Pipeline

* **Capture**: Ingest live Space audio through virtual cable or loopback (e.g., VoiceMeeter).
* **STT**: Real-time speech-to-text with partial streaming transcripts.
* **Latency Budget**: First response under 2s; max total reply length 30s.
* **Mix-Minus Routing**: Ensure no feedback loop with host mic.
* **Echo/Noise Handling**: Acoustic echo cancellation, background noise suppression, and double-talk handling.

---

### Conversational Behavior

* **Turn-Taking**:

  * Stops within 300ms if interrupted.
  * Summarizes and yields with “Over to you.”
  * Escalates tricky questions to host with a one-line suggestion.
* **Response Styles**:

  * Witty jokes, fun facts, probing questions, smooth pivots.
  * Expressive TTS with prosody control (tempo, pitch, energy).
  * Personalities: energetic podcaster, street-comedy voice, geeky UFO researcher (and more, user-customizable).
* **Voice Swaps**: On-demand voice change with previews.

### Memory & Knowledge

* **Session Memory**: Temporary context for the live show.
* **Long-Term Memory**: Stores past Spaces, lore, guest habits, running jokes.
* **Knowledge Base**: Dedicated file-fed repository for research and reference.
* **Memory Control**:

  * Forget: “Forget that.”
  * Pin: “Keep that.”
  * Expiry policies with confidence scores.
* **Summarization**: After each show, generate a recap with top 5 moments, timestamps, and future talking points.

---

### Retrieval & Web Access

* **Topic Map**: Rolling entity and stance tracker for the Space.
* **Web Search**: Enable live fact-checking or enrichment when asked.
* **Retrieval Policy**:

  * Live answers capped at 20s.
  * Timeout → bridge conversationally + promise follow-up.

---

### Personalization

* **Dynamic Prosody**: Adjust tone by intent (joke, fact, probe, bridge).
* **Blend Modes**: Combine personalities (e.g., 60% researcher, 40% comedy).
* **Speaker Awareness**: Diarization tied to Space handles. Uses names in replies (“Thanks Olivia…”).

---

### Control & Interaction

* **Hotkeys/Commands**:

  * “Riff on that.”
  * “One-liner only.”
  * “Wrap in 10.”
  * “Switch tone to…”
  * “Pause/hold/skip.”
* **Handoff**: Agent queues outro and stays silent until reactivated.

### Showcraft Features

* **Cold Opens**: Generate engaging introductions.
* **Segment Bumpers**: Short stings or pivots.
* **Sponsor Reads**: Adjustable tone presets.
* **Running Jokes**: Recall lore and callbacks from prior shows.

### Analytics & Reporting

* **Metrics Logged**:

  * Latency per reply.
  * Speaking time share.
  * Interrupt count.
  * Joke success (via reactions).
  * Clip-worthy moments (sentiment spikes).
* **Post-Show**: One-page report + 5 clip suggestions.

### Resilience & Fallback

* **Low Confidence Handling**: Paraphrase back before answering.
* **Network Shakiness**: Shorter, clearer sentences.
* **Crash Recovery**: Switch to minimal “acknowledge & toss back” mode.

---

### Deployment & Packaging

* **Local First**: Raw audio stays local unless cloud features are toggled.
* **Encrypted Memory**: All long-term stores encrypted at rest.
* **Test Harness**:

  * Median time-to-first-word < 2s.
  * 95th percentile < 3s.
  * < 2 overlap violations/hour.
  * Joke hit rate above baseline threshold.

### Master Prompt Schema

Always structure outputs with:

* **Role**: Cohost.
* **Audience**: Twitter/X Space listeners.
* **Segment**: Current part of the show.
* **Tone Recipe**: Personality blend + prosody.
* **Topic Map Snapshot**: Entities and stances.
* **Constraints**: 30s max, no forbidden moves.
* **Output Contract**:

  * Opener line.
  * Core answer.
  * Callback/reference.
  * Baton back to host.

With this design, you don’t just get a “cohost bot.” You get a **stage partner, production assistant, and analytics tool all in one**—tuned for live Spaces performance.
